Hello! I’m Wu (吴) Bin (彬), a first-year graduate student at [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://whu.edu.cn/). You can also call me by my online name Luo (罗) Jiaming (家明), which is pronounced similarly to "珞珈民" in Chinese, referring to the residents of Mount Luojia. 

Currently I'm a member of the [Mars Group](https://marswhu.github.io/), advised by [Prof. Ye Mang](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/yemang/zh_CN/index.htm). My research interests lie broadly in artificial intelligence, especially topics related to deep learning and computer vision. My current work focuses on **continual learning** and **domain generalization**.

My profile picture is a typical scene of Akiyuki 45° taken from "Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko".
